## UI Test Plan

**Project:** E-Commerce End-to-End QA Testing Framework


**Prepared by:** Pooja Bankar


**Test Type:** Manual UI Testing (Requirement-based)


--------------------------------
## 1. Objective


The objective of this test plan is to validate the expected UI behavior of an e-commerce application by testing core user workflows such as authentication, product browsing, cart management, and checkout.


Since DummyJSON provides backend APIs only, UI test cases are designed based on how a standard e-commerce frontend would consume these APIs and present data to end users.


This test plan was created as part of a hands-on QA portfolio project to strengthen end-to-end testing skills.


------------------

## 2. Scope

   
## **In Scope:**


  User authentication (login/logout)


  Product listing, search, and filtering


  Shopping cart operations (add, update, remove items)


  Checkout flow


  Error handling and user messages


## **Out of Scope:**


  UI design elements (colors, fonts, layout)


  Performance and load testing


  Accessibility testing


  Third-party integrations (payments, notifications)


----------------------------
## 3. Test Approach


UI test cases are derived from business and functional requirements.


Testing focuses on validating user-visible behavior based on backend API responses.


Both positive and negative scenarios are covered.


Manual test execution using requirement-based and exploratory testing techniques.


-------------------------
## 4. Test Environment


Assumed web-based e-commerce frontend


Backend APIs provided by DummyJSON


Manual execution without UI automation tools


------------------------
## 5. Test Data


Sample users, products, and cart data provided by DummyJSON APIs


Valid and invalid credential combinations for authentication testing


------------------------------
## 6. Entry Criteria


Business and functional requirements are finalized


DummyJSON APIs are accessible and stable


Test scenarios and test cases are reviewed and approved


----------------------------
## 7. Exit Criteria


All planned UI test cases are executed


Critical and high-priority defects are identified and documented


Test results are recorded with execution status

----------------
## 9. Risks & Assumptions
    

Assumes a standard e-commerce UI consuming DummyJSON APIs


No real frontend implementation available for validation


UI behavior may vary based on actual frontend implementation


----------------------------

## 10. Approval


This test plan is prepared for learning, demonstration, and portfolio purposes to showcase end-to-end QA testing
