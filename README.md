# E-Commerce End-to-End QA Testing Framework

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end Quality Assurance testing for an e-commerce application using a public API.  
The focus is on **requirements analysis, test design, manual API testing**, and maintaining clear QA documentation aligned with SDLC and STLC practices.

## Scope of Testing
- Manual API testing of product-related endpoints
- Functional validation
- Positive and negative test scenarios
- Response validation (status codes, payload structure)

## Application Under Test
- Public E-Commerce API (Fake Store API)

## Testing Artifacts
- **Requirements:** Defined functional requirements for product APIs  
- **Test Scenarios:** High-level test scenarios derived from requirements  
- **Test Cases:** Detailed test cases with expected results  

## Tools & Technologies
- Postman (Manual API Testing)
- GitHub (Version Control & Documentation)

## Project Structure
The project is organized to reflect a real-world QA testing workflow, following SDLC and STLC best practices.

- **requirements/**  
  Contains functional requirements derived from the application under test.

- **test-scenarios/**  
  Includes high-level test scenarios mapped to the defined requirements.

- **test-cases/**
