# E-Commerce End-to-End QA Testing Portfolio

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end Quality Assurance workflow** for a sample e-commerce application.  
It covers **requirements analysis, test scenario design, test case creation, and manual testing across API, UI, and database layers**, following industry-aligned SDLC and STLC practices.

The project is intentionally structured to be **scalable**, allowing future expansion into **automation and CI/CD pipelines**.

---

## Scope of Testing
- Requirements analysis and test design
- Manual API testing (functional, negative, edge cases)
- Manual UI testing (basic user flows)
- Database / SQL validation (data consistency checks)
- Defect-oriented and exploratory testing
- Documentation and execution evidence

---

## Application Under Test
- **Backend:** Public E-commerce API (DummyJSON / Fake Store–style API)
- **Frontend (Manual UI Testing):** Public demo e-commerce UI / API-driven UI
- **Database:** Logical SQL validation (query-based validation aligned with API responses)

---

## Testing Artifacts
- **Requirements:** Functional requirements derived from business expectations
- **Test Scenarios:** High-level scenarios mapped to requirements
- **Test Cases:** Detailed manual test cases for:
  - API testing
  - UI testing
  - SQL / data validation
- **Execution Evidence:** Screenshots and API responses captured during testing

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Postman:** Manual API testing and validation
- **SQL:** Backend data validation
- **GitHub:** Version control and QA documentation
- **(Future Scope):** Selenium, RestAssured, Jenkins

---

## Project Structure
The repository is organized to mirror a real-world QA lifecycle:

- **requirements/**  
  Functional requirements for the e-commerce application

- **test-scenarios/**  
  High-level test scenarios derived from requirements

- **test-cases/**  
  - `api/` – API test cases  
  - `ui/` – UI test cases  
  - `sql/` – Database validation test cases  

- **postman/**  
  Postman collections used for manual API testing

- **screenshots/**  
  Execution evidence for API and UI testing

- **automation/** *(future scope)*  
  Placeholder for API/UI automation frameworks

---

## Future Enhancements
- API automation using RestAssured / Postman
- UI automation using Selenium WebDriver
- CI/CD integration using Jenkins or GitHub Actions
- Extended SQL/database validation
